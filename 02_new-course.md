### Course: Introduction to Data Science
I think data science is really wonderful (hence why I decided to pursue a degree in the topic) and I haven't found the opportunity to dive into it too much in the current curriculum.

I think it's really important to show students some of the different areas computer science skill can take them towards and give them exposire to different topics.
