# Comparing CSP Curriculums
## Code.org vs CodeHS

I've used the Code.org curriculum in the past and found that I genrealy like what they provide. It is easily editable so I can customize the lessons for my style and my students and it flows in a really nice manner overall.

### Major Differences
Code. org has a much shorter curriculum than CodeHS. While the topics are the same, the units are much more broken down in the CodeHS curriculum and their are more practice performance tasks included.

### Major Similarities
Both curriculums cover the same topic and make solid use of a turtle and dedicated coding environment to support students.

### Comparison of Strengths and Weaknesses
I don't know if one of the curriculums performs better on a particular topic, but I think the Code.org curriculum feels more cohesive and organized overall than the CodeHS curriculum. The massive unit breakdown in the CodeHS curriculum just feels very unorganized and a little all over the place. The website also feels more challenging to use, which is a mjor issue when working with students.

### What Would I Adopt
There could be value in the CodeHS method of having tons of practice performance tasks, but only if I found that I truly had the time to implement them. I wouldn't want to throw the projects into my curriculum only to find students rushing through parts of the year because we'd fallen behind.
