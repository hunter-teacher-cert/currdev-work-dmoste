## Standard 1
### 2-3.NSD.4
Recognize that information can be communicated using different representations that satisfy different rules.

Students could be tasked with building a device to send binary messages across the classroom. Students could use any materials in their possesion. The goal is to be able to answer a binary question without verbal language.

This forces students to think of ways to communicate outside of their normal mode of operation. A small wrap up that explicitly mentions that students communicated in different ways from each other ties directly back to the standard.

## Standard 2
### 7-8.NSD.4
Design a protocol for transmitting data through a multi-point network.

Students could use the [Internet Simulator from Code.org](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2019/lessons/10/levels/2) to experience how routers operate and move information through the internet.

This simulator directly asks students to design a potential protocol and experience the shortcoming/flaws in their design.
