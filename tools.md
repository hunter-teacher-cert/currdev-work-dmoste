Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). Include:
- The name of the tool.
- What its general purpose is.
- The class(es) you use it in.
- How you use it in class.
- Why you have selected that tool for that purpose?

I use the Code.org IDE. The purpose of the IDE is to provide a coding environment. I use it in AP CSP. It is used during the coding portions of the course. I use it because of the easy transition between block and text coding. I think this provides students with the most scaffolding and support.

I also use Canvas which is a communication and organization platform. I use it in all my classes and I use ut to disseminate assignments, grade student work, make announcements, and provide discussion forums for students. I use this tool because it is free and is much more customizable than google classroom.
