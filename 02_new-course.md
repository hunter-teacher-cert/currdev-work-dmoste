### Course: Introduction to Data Science
I think data science is really wonderful (hence why I decided to pursue a degree in the topic) and I haven't found the opportunity to dive into it too much in the current curriculum.

The goal of the course would be to expose students to basic data science concepts. This includes data cleaning, regression, classification, forecasting, visualizations, and modeling.

The target audiance for the course would be students that have completed a higher lever course such as AP CSA. The prerequisite isn't striclty AP CSA, but any course that has a similar level of coding.

Ideally, this would be a senior capstone course in the CS department. Due to the mathematical nature of many of the topics, it would be difficult for students in the lower grades to find this course accessible.
