# Language: Javascript
**What is the course? (grade level, student experience)**

CSP for 10th and 11th grade students. This is an introductory course (no prior coding experience).  

**What is the language?**

Javascript

**How does one write & run code in this language?**

Code for javascript can be run directly in the Code.org IDE within a browser.

**Rate the complexity of the syntax?**

The syntax is less complex than java, but more intense than python. The Code.org IDE provides the ability to use block coding with javascript.

**Strengths**

The language is powerful, but it isn't super syntax heavy. It also has the cool factor of being a typed language.

**How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?**

I think there is value in playing up the cool factor of being a typed language. I also think I could use the strength of the Code.org IDE to eliminate most of the syntax requirements, which would make the language easier for students.

**Weaknesses**

The main weakness of javascript is that there is no IDE than can be downloaded directly onto a computer, which means you are at the mercy of the local wifi connection.

**How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?**

Having a series of unpluged activities that could be used at a moments notice would provide me with backup options for when the internet is struggling.

**Why did you select this language for this class?**

I think javascript provides the cool factor of being a typed language with some of the ease of a block language (especiialy when used with Code.org)
